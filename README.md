# Olympic-Dataset-Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on automating the data analysis process by utilizing Databricks and Snowflake. It involves storing data in an AWS S3 bucket, extracting and transforming the data using Databricks and PySpark, loading the processed data into Snowflake, and performing analytical queries to generate insights from the Olympic dataset.

Key Features
1. Data Storage: The project leverages the scalability and durability of AWS S3 to securely store the Olympic dataset. Users can access and manage their data in the S3 bucket.
2. Data Extraction and Transformation: Databricks is employed as a powerful tool to connect to the S3 bucket and extract the Olympic dataset. PySpark, a Python library compatible with Databricks, is used to efficiently transform and process the data, ensuring its readiness for analysis.
3. Data Loading into Snowflake: Databricks is seamlessly connected to Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing solution. The processed Olympic data is loaded into Snowflake, enabling easy data storage and management for further analysis.
4. Analytical Queries with Snowflake:
  With the Olympic dataset successfully loaded into Snowflake, users can leverage Snowflake's SQL capabilities to perform complex analytical queries. This includes querying and aggregating the data, applying filters and joins, and conducting calculations to generate valuable insights from the dataset.
